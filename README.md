# Hi there, welcome to my Git Dome!

## About Me

I'm **Arthur Mastropietro**, a passionate **Senior Software & Blockchain Engineer** with 15+ years of experience crafting scalable, reliable, and high-performance systems. I specialize in **Golang**, with strong expertise in **blockchain**, **microservices**, and **AI integrations**. I love solving complex problems, writing clean code, and collaborating with great teams. Besides that i also play guitar in a heavy metal band, but that does not pay the bills.
